# CS205-Warmup

My group has decided to focus our dataset on songs. We will pull information about different tracks such as year, artist, genre for use in our warm-up project.

We will be storing Songs and Artists.
Attributes of songs: Name, length of track/song, genre, year, artists
Attributes of Artists: Name, age, genre, origin/band, songs
Of course, our relationship is between artists and songs. (Sung/Written)
This is still up for change as we may choose a different dataset as a group in the near future.
